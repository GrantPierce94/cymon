## How to Play

In Cymon, battles are conducted in a turn-based style, similar to classic Pokémon games. Here are the typical controls and mechanics for battles:

- **Move Selection**: Each Cymon has a set of moves or abilities they can use during battles. Players select moves from a list of available options.
- **Turn-Based Actions**: Battles proceed in turns, with each participant taking actions one after the other.
- **HP (Hit Points)**: Each Cymon has a certain amount of HP representing their health. Attacks reduce the opponent's HP, and the battle continues until one Cymon's HP reaches zero.
- **Types and Effectiveness**: Cymons have different types (e.g., fire, water, grass), and move types can have advantages or disadvantages against specific Cymon types. For example, a water-type move might be super effective against a fire-type Cymon.
- **Status Effects**: Moves may inflict status conditions (like paralysis, burn, poison) that affect a Cymon's performance in battle.
- **Switching Cymons**: Players can switch their active Cymon during a battle to gain a type advantage or conserve a weakened Cymon.
- **Battle Outcome**: The battle ends when all Cymons of one player are unable to continue battling. The victorious player earns rewards such as experience points, items, or currency.

Understanding type matchups, strategic move selection, and managing Cymon stats during battles are key to achieving success in Cymon battles.

These controls and mechanics contribute to the strategic depth and excitement of Cymon battles, offering a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
